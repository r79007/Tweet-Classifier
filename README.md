# Tweet-Classifier

This is the tweet classifier in which I used BERT. 
I removed a number of tweets which had happy as the sentiment, to reduce model overfitting.

The notebook that includes the work done is called tweet-classifier-BERT.ipynb

To use the app, run `streamlit run app.py` (But it won't work because all the required files could not be uploaded)
